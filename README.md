Aegina Injector is a proof of concept injector using various different methods to excecute a dll into a target. The current version only supports 64 bit processes and dll files
(this will change in the near future). It is not specifically meant to bypass any game anti-cheats, it is just **proof of concept**.

## How do i use this injector?

Make sure that Aegina.dll is in the same path as AeginaUI.exe otherwise it will not work. Open AeginaUI.exe then enter your target process example "Taskmgr.exe" (it may auto-fill) then choose injection options. After this you can click inject, if all goes well, it will say "Injection Success".
